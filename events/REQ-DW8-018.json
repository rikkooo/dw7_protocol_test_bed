  "title": "[Sherlock Mode] Investigate and Redesign Environment Management and Enforcement",
  "description": "A persistent pain point in the development cycle is the inconsistent and fragile virtual environment (`venv`) management. The environment context is frequently lost between sessions or stage transitions, forcing repeated, manual re-installation of dependencies and causing unnecessary delays and errors.\n\nThis \"Sherlock Mode\" requirement is to investigate the root cause of this problem and design a robust, automated enforcement mechanism.",

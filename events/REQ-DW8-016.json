  "description": "It has been observed that the agent (Gem) sometimes operates outside the bounds of the prescribed development workflow. This \"free as a bird\" behavior indicates that the protocol has exploitable holes that compromise the structured, step-by-step process we aim to enforce.\n\nThis requirement initiates a \"Sherlock Mode\" investigation to understand why this happens and to design fortifications to keep the agent \"on the tracks.\"",

  "description": "This requirement completes the transition to a fully JSON-based event system. It involves creating a migration script to convert all existing requirement .md files in docs/reqs/ into structured .json files in a new events/ directory. The WorkflowKernel will then be updated to read directly from these JSON files, eliminating the need for markdown parsing.",

  "title": "[Execution] Refactor All Major Classes to Use Code Granularity Protocol",
  "description": "The Code Granularity Protocol, successfully implemented for `deployer.py`, has proven to be a powerful pattern for reducing context size, improving maintainability, and enhancing edit reliability. This pattern involves transforming large classes into lean interfaces that dynamically load their methods from individual files in a dedicated subdirectory.\n\nThis requirement serves as an epic or theme to apply this same refactoring pattern to all other major, monolithic classes within the project codebase.",

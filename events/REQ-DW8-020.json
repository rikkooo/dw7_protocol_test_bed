  "title": "Implement Context Window Canary & System Health Check",
  "description": "To combat context loss, the workflow will use a 'canary' value (like a password) stored in its state. At key points, the Governor will check if the agent remembers the canary. A failure triggers a 'Small Boot' procedure to perform a full context refresh and system health check.",

      "text": "A canary value is stored in workflow_state.json.",

      "text": "The kernel has a mechanism to validate the agent's memory of the canary.",

  "title": "[Execution] Replace `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` with Event Queues",
  "description": "This requirement is to replace the single, monolithic `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` file with a more robust and efficient dual-queue system implemented in JSON. This is a foundational step in the OS refactoring.\n\n- **`pending_events.json`**: Will hold the list of tasks to be processed.\n- **`processed_events.json`**: Will hold a log of completed tasks.\n\n## 3. Sherlock Mode Findings (2025-06-28)\n\n- **Contradiction Identified:** The investigation revealed a critical architectural flaw. The system has two competing sources of truth for the event queue.\n- **State Manager (`WorkflowManager`):** Correctly initializes the `WorkflowKernel` with a `PendingEvents` list stored within the primary `data/workflow_state.json` file.\n- **Kernel (`WorkflowKernel`):** While the main workflow uses the state-provided list, several key methods (`_complete_event_in_queue`, `_create_red_flag_requirement`) incorrectly read from and write to the separate `data/pending_events.json` and `data/processed_events.json` files.\n- **Conclusion:** This violation of the \"single source of truth\" principle is the root cause of recent instability and context loss. The system's state management must be unified before proceeding.",

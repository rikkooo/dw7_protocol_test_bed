  "description": "To combat context window resets (\"memory loss\"), which pose a critical threat to project stability, we will implement a proactive Context Integrity Protocol. This protocol will provide a reliable, automated mechanism for detecting and recovering from context loss, ensuring the AI engineer remains synchronized with the project's state and goals.",

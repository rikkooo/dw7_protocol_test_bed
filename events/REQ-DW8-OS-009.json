  "description": "This requirement implements the \"interrupt\" mechanism for our OS. It provides a method to inject a new, high-priority event at the front of the `pending_events.json` queue, ensuring it is processed next, regardless of other pending tasks. This is critical for handling urgent bugs or incorporating new ideas from brainstorming sessions.",

  "title": "Restore and Adapt Engineer Stage SMR Validation",
  "description": "The Engineer stage validation, which ensures requirements are broken down into at least two Sub-task Measurable Requirements (SMRs), was temporarily disabled to facilitate a documentation refactor (REQ-DW8-DOC-003). This requirement is to restore that validation logic, adapting it to the new documentation structure where the docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md file no longer exists. The new logic should parse the SMRs from the active requirement's entry in the master docs/README.md file.",

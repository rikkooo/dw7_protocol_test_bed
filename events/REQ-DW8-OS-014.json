  "title": "Refactor `WorkflowKernel` to Use Centralized State",
  "description": "With the `WorkflowState` class enhanced to manage event queues, the `WorkflowKernel` must be refactored to delegate all state and queue operations to the `WorkflowState` object. This will eliminate the kernel's direct file access and resolve the \"dual source of truth\" problem.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    {
      "text": "The `_complete_event_in_queue` method in `WorkflowKernel` is refactored. It no longer writes to `processed_events.json`. Instead, it calls the new `self.state.archive_completed_event()` method.",

    {
      "text": "The `create_new_requirement` method in `WorkflowKernel` is refactored. It no longer writes to `pending_events.json`. Instead, it calls the new `self.state.add_pending_event()` method.",

    {
      "text": "The `_create_red_flag_requirement` method in `WorkflowKernel` is refactored to use `self.state.add_pending_event()` to inject the critical failure event into the queue.",

  "title": "[Design] Re-design the `Rehearsal` Stage as an Interrupt Handler",
  "description": "This requirement is to formally re-design the `Rehearsal` stage to fit the new OS paradigm. It will be documented as a formal \"Interrupt Handler\" that is triggered by the Kernel on repeated instruction failures. The design will specify the exact inputs it receives from the Kernel (e.g., the failing event) and the outputs it must produce (e.g., a revised plan).",

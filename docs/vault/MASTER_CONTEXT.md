# DW8 Protocol: Master Context Document

This document serves as the central index for the entire DW8 project. It is intended for use in a "total recall" scenario, where the AI agent needs a complete context refresh, such as before attempting to upgrade the protocol itself.

## Core Project Documentation

- **[Project Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md):** The single source of truth for the project's design, state machine, core components, and folder structure.

- **[Master Requirement Index](./PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md):** The master list of all project tasks, their priorities, and their statuses. This file will be re-architected into a lightweight index that points to detailed requirement files.

- **[AI Protocol Tutorial](./AI_PROTOCOL_TUTORIAL.md):** A concise guide for the AI agent to refresh its understanding of the workflow, commands, and failure handling protocols.

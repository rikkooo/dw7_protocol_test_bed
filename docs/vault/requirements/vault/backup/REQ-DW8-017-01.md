# REQ-DW8-017-01 - Implement Strict Environment Variable Loading

**Type:** Standard
**Status:** Pending

## Description

The kernel must load environment variables exclusively from a .env file at the root and fail immediately if the file is missing or incomplete.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Kernel fails on startup if .env is not found.
- All required environment variables are documented and checked.
- No hardcoded secrets or paths are present in the code.

### ID: REQ-DW8-074

- **Title:** End-to-End Test of New Architecture
- **Status:** `Pending`
- **Priority:** `High`
- **Details:** This requirement is to perform a full, end-to-end test of the newly implemented DW8 architecture. The test will validate the pointer-based memory system, the refined context refresh protocol, and the overall stability of the workflow.
- **SMRs:**
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-074.1:** Start the workflow from the `Engineer` stage.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-074.2:** As the `Coder`, create a simple test file (e.g., `tests/test_architecture.py`) that asserts a basic truth (e.g., `assert True`).
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-074.3:** As the `Validator`, run the test suite and confirm it passes.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-074.4:** As the `Deployer`, complete the deployment stage successfully.

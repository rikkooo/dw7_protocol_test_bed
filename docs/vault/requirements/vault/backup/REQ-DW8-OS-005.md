# REQ-DW8-OS-005: [Execution] Migrate Requirement Details from Markdown to JSON Files

## 1. Description

This requirement completes the transition to a fully JSON-based event system. It involves creating a migration script to convert all existing requirement .md files in docs/reqs/ into structured .json files in a new events/ directory. The WorkflowKernel will then be updated to read directly from these JSON files, eliminating the need for markdown parsing.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A migration script scripts/migrate_reqs_to_json.py is created.
- [ ] The script successfully parses all .md files in docs/reqs/ and creates corresponding .json files in events/.
- [ ] The WorkflowKernel._load_event_details method is refactored to read directly from the new .json files.
- [ ] The old markdown parsing logic in the kernel is removed.
- [ ] All tests pass after the refactoring.

# REQ-DW8-OS-012: [Design] Re-design the `Rehearsal` Stage as an Interrupt Handler

- **Priority:** [H]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Design

## 1. Description

This requirement is to formally re-design the `Rehearsal` stage to fit the new OS paradigm. It will be documented as a formal "Interrupt Handler" that is triggered by the Kernel on repeated instruction failures. The design will specify the exact inputs it receives from the Kernel (e.g., the failing event) and the outputs it must produce (e.g., a revised plan).

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- The `Rehearsal` stage logic is fully re-designed and documented.
- The documentation clearly explains its role as an interrupt handler within the DW8-OS architecture.

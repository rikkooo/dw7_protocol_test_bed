# REQ-DW8-OS-009: [Execution] Implement Dynamic Event Prioritization

- **Priority:** [M]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Execution

## 1. Description

This requirement implements the "interrupt" mechanism for our OS. It provides a method to inject a new, high-priority event at the front of the `pending_events.json` queue, ensuring it is processed next, regardless of other pending tasks. This is critical for handling urgent bugs or incorporating new ideas from brainstorming sessions.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- A new CLI command or system function is created to add an event to the front of the pending queue.
- The Kernel correctly processes the high-priority event before returning to the previous queue order.

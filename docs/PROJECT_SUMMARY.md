# Project Summary: The DW8 Protocol Enhancement

## 1. Project Purpose: The Evolution to a Self-Aware Workflow

The "DW8 Protocol Enhancement" project is a mission to upgrade our development framework from DW7 to DW8. The core purpose is to create a more intelligent and resilient system that can:

- **Combat Cognitive Fixation:** By introducing a `Rehearsal` state, the AI is forced to stop, reflect, and find new solutions when faced with repeated failures, breaking unproductive loops.
- **Prevent Context Decay:** By formalizing all high-level goals into a master requirements list (`PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`) and using structured protocols, we ensure the AI never loses sight of the strategic objectives.
- **Enforce Robustness:** Implement strict protocols for command execution, environment management, and deployment to eliminate common sources of error and instability.

## 2. Core Architecture: A Protocol-Driven State Machine

The system is architected as a state machine managed by a central **Kernel**.

- **The Kernel (`WorkflowManager`):** The brain of the operation, responsible for managing transitions between states.
- **The State (`WorkflowState`):** A JSON file acting as the system's memory, tracking the current stage, failure counters, and critical flags like `is_protocol_update`.
- **The Protocols:** A set of formal, documented procedures stored in `docs/protocols/` that govern how specific, critical tasks are performed. We have already defined protocols for:
  - `DW8_CODE_GRANULARITY_PROTOCOL.md`: Refactoring monolithic classes into modular, dynamically loaded interfaces.
  - `DW8_DEPLOYER_PROTOCOL.md`: A formal process for versioning and releasing new versions of the DW protocol itself.
  - `DW8_DYNAMIC_REQUIREMENT_PROTOCOL.md`: A system for managing a master list of prioritized requirements.
  - `DW8_ROBUST_COMMAND_PROTOCOL.md`: A procedure for capturing the full, untruncated output of critical shell commands to ensure accurate analysis.

## 3. The State Machine and Modes of Operation

The workflow progresses through a series of well-defined stages, or "modes":

- **`Engineer` -> `Researcher` -> `Coder` -> `Validator` -> `Deployer`:** This is the primary path from high-level planning to a deployed solution.
- **`Rehearsal` (Circuit Breaker):** A special, reflective state triggered by repeated failures in any other stage.
- **`Sherlock Mode` (Investigation):** A designated phase for deep investigation and design *before* any code is written. All our current `REQ-DW8` tasks are in this mode.
- **`Execution Mode` (Implementation):** The phase for writing code to implement a previously designed solution.

## 4. Key Documents and Their Locations

- `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`: The single source of truth for all high-level project goals, dynamically prioritized.
- `docs/reqs/`: Contains detailed, individual requirement documents.
- `docs/protocols/`: Contains the formal definitions of our core protocols.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Provides a detailed overview of the system's components and their interactions.
- `docs/DW6_ISSUES.md`: A historical log of the problems in the previous protocol version that motivated the creation of DW8.

## 5. Current Status and Immediate Next Steps

- **Status:** We have successfully completed the **initial design and formalization phase** of the DW8 protocol. We have a clear architectural vision and a set of foundational protocols.
- **Next Steps:** We are at the very beginning of the **Sherlock Mode (Investigation)** for the DW8 epic. Our immediate goal is to execute the investigations outlined in requirements `REQ-DW8-015` through `REQ-DW8-020`. This involves designing the specific mechanisms for:
  1. Governor Gatekeeping Rules
  2. Workflow Adherence & Versioning
  3. Environment Management Enforcement
  4. Git/Deployment Enhancements
  5. MD to JSON Document Transition

Once these designs are complete, we will create a new batch of "Execution Mode" requirements to build and integrate these features into the kernel.

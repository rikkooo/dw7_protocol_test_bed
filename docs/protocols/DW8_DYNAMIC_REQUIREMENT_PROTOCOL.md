# DW8 Protocol: Dynamic Requirement Management

This document formalizes the standard operating procedure for handling the creation of new Meta-Requirements (MRs) during an active development workflow. This protocol ensures that new ideas, improvements, or bug fixes are captured, prioritized, and integrated without losing momentum.

## 1. Principle

The DW8 workflow must be agile and responsive to new information. This protocol provides a structured way to pause the current task, formalize a new requirement, and intelligently resume work based on the most current priorities.

## 2. The Trigger

This sub-workflow can be triggered at any time by:

- A direct user interruption to suggest a new feature, improvement, or bug fix.
- An AI-initiated `Rehearsal` or `Spontaneous Reflection` that uncovers a deeper issue requiring a new MR.
- The conclusion of a brainstorming session.

## 3. The Procedure

Upon triggering, the AI agent will execute the following steps:

1.  **Acknowledge and Pause:** Announce the initiation of the Dynamic Requirement Protocol and pause the current task.
2.  **Formalize the Requirement:** Create a new, detailed MR file in the `docs/reqs/` directory.
    - Assign a new, sequential ID (e.g., `REQ-DW8-XXX`).
    - Define the Title, Status (defaulting to `Pending`), Priority (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`), Details, and a checklist of Sub-Meta-Requirements (SMRs).
3.  **Update the Master Index:** Add a reference to the new MR file in `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
4.  **Execute the Rescheduling Protocol:** This is the most critical step. Re-read the entire, updated `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` file and re-sort the list of all `Pending` requirements according to their priority (`Critical` first, then `High`, `Medium`, `Low`). This ensures the workflow's focus is always on the most important task.
5.  **Announce and Resume:** Announce the new, top-priority task and resume the workflow by beginning work on that requirement.

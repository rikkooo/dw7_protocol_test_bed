# REQ-DW8-010

## ID: REQ-DW8-010

- **Title:** Implement Dual-Push for Protocol Evolution
- **Status:** `Pending`
- **Priority:** `High`
- **Details:** This requirement is to implement the dual-push mechanism for projects that update the DW protocol itself (`is_protocol_update` is true).
- **SMRs:**
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-010.1:** In the `Deployer` stage, after a cycle is complete, first perform the standard project push to its own test-bed repository (as defined in REQ-DW8-008).
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-010.2:** After the first push is successful, copy the updated workflow source code (e.g., from `src/dw6`) to the official protocol directory path defined in `docs/DEPLOYER_CONFIGURATION.md`.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-010.3:** Perform a second commit and push of the updated protocol code to the official `windsurf-development-workflow` repository URL (also defined in the configuration file).
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-010.4:** Ensure both pushes are versioned appropriately.

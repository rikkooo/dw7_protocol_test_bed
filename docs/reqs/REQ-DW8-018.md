# REQ-DW8-018: [Sherlock Mode] Investigate and Redesign Environment Management and Enforcement

- **Priority:** [H]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Sherlock Mode (Investigation & Design)

## 1. Description

A persistent pain point in the development cycle is the inconsistent and fragile virtual environment (`venv`) management. The environment context is frequently lost between sessions or stage transitions, forcing repeated, manual re-installation of dependencies and causing unnecessary delays and errors.

This "Sherlock Mode" requirement is to investigate the root cause of this problem and design a robust, automated enforcement mechanism.

## 2. The Plan

### 2.1. Phase 1: Investigation

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate the underlying reasons for environment context loss, including shell behavior, tool limitations, and script design.
- **State Tracking Review:** Analyze how environment state is currently tracked (or not tracked) across different stages and sessions.
- **Tooling Assessment:** Evaluate whether the current tooling (`uv`, shell scripts) is being used optimally or if alternative approaches are needed.

### 2.2. Phase 2: Design Enforcement Protocol

- **Environment Checks:** Design mandatory, automated checks at the beginning of the Coder, Validator, and Deployer stages to verify the `venv` is active.
- **Context-Aware Activation:** The protocol should be intelligent enough to activate the correct environment automatically if it's not active.
- **Clear Feedback:** If activation fails, the system must provide clear, user-friendly error messages and guidance.
- **Granular Implementation:** The design should be broken down into new, specific "Execution Mode" requirements for implementation.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- A report is produced detailing the root causes of environment context loss.
- A clear design for an environment enforcement protocol is documented.
- New, granular requirements are created to implement the protocol for each relevant stage (Coder, Validator, Deployer).

# REQ-DW8-015: [Sherlock Mode] Investigate and Redesign State Machine Gatekeeping Rules

- **Priority:** [H]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Sherlock Mode (Investigation & Design)

## 1. Description

The project's state machine, managed by the "Governor," has shown signs of weakness. The transition criteria between stages (Engineer, Coder, Validator, Deployer) are not being strictly enforced, allowing for an unstructured and sometimes anarchical workflow. This undermines the stability and predictability of the development protocol.

This requirement initiates a "Sherlock Mode" investigation to address this critical issue. No code will be implemented under this requirement.

## 2. The Plan

### 2.1. Phase 1: Investigation

The primary goal is to conduct a deep analysis of the current system to understand the root cause of the failure. This includes:

- **Code Review:** Examine the state transition logic within the Governor and related components.
- **Log Analysis:** Review past execution logs to identify specific instances where transitions occurred without proper validation.
- **Identify Loopholes:** Pinpoint the exact architectural or logical flaws that allow the gatekeeping rules to be bypassed.

### 2.2. Phase 2: Collaborative Design

Following the investigation, we will collaboratively brainstorm and design a new, robust set of gatekeeping rules. Key considerations will be:

- **Strong Criteria:** Define clear, strict, and verifiable conditions for entering each stage.
- **Flexibility:** While rules must be strong, we will design mechanisms for flexibility and manual overrides in critical or exceptional situations to avoid deadlocks.
- **Clear Feedback:** The Governor must provide clear, actionable feedback when a transition is denied.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- A comprehensive document is produced detailing the findings of the investigation.
- A new set of proposed gatekeeping rules is documented, including logic for handling exceptions.
- A set of new, granular "Execution Mode" requirements are created to implement the proposed changes.

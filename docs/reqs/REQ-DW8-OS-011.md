# REQ-DW8-OS-011: [Design] Design and Document a `CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md`

- **Priority:** [M]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Design

## 1. Description

To combat context decay, this requirement is to design a formal protocol for managing the AI's context window. Initially, this will be a simple, periodic refresh strategy. The protocol will define when and what context should be provided to the AI to keep it aligned with the project's high-level goals.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- A new file, `docs/protocols/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md`, is created.
- The protocol defines the triggers (e.g., every 10 cycles) and the content for context refreshes.

# REQ-DW8-020: [Sherlock Mode] Investigate Transitioning Key Documents from MD to JSON

- **Priority:** [L]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Sherlock Mode (Investigation & Design)

## 1. Description

Many of our project's core documents (requirements, state files, etc.) are in Markdown format. While flexible, MD can be difficult to parse systematically and is more prone to formatting errors that can break automated processes. JSON, being a strictly structured format, could offer more reliability for machine-readable documents.

This "Sherlock Mode" requirement is to investigate the feasibility and benefits of transitioning some of our documents from Markdown to JSON.

## 2. The Plan

### 2.1. Phase 1: Analysis

- **Identify Candidates:** Review all project documents (`PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`, state files, protocol definitions, etc.) and identify which ones are primarily machine-read and would benefit most from a structured format.
- **Weigh Pros and Cons:** For each candidate, conduct a cost-benefit analysis.
  - **Pros of JSON:** Strict schema, reliable parsing, less ambiguity.
  - **Cons of JSON:** Less human-readable, does not support comments, more verbose for simple lists.
- **Propose a Strategy:** Based on the analysis, create a recommendation report detailing which files (if any) should be converted to JSON.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- A report is produced that analyzes the project's documents and provides a clear recommendation on which ones should be converted to JSON.
- If conversion is recommended, new "Execution Mode" requirements are created to carry out the file format changes.

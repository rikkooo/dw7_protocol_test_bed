# REQ-DW8-021 - Implement Advanced Requirement Prioritization

**Type:** Standard
**Status:** Pending

## Description

The workflow needs a more sophisticated method for prioritizing requirements. This will include the ability to insert new requirements at specific positions in the queue (e.g., middle) to represent medium priority, in addition to high (top) and low (bottom).

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new CLI command or flag exists to specify priority (High, Medium, Low).
- 'High' priority places the requirement at the start of the queue.
- 'Low' priority places it at the end.
- 'Medium' priority places it in the middle of the current queue.

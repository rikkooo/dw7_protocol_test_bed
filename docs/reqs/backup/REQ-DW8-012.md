# REQ-DW8-012

## ID: REQ-DW8-012

- **Title:** Document Requirement List Abbreviations
- **Status:** `Pending`
- **Priority:** `Low`
- **Details:** The master requirement index at `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` uses single-character abbreviations for Status and Priority. This is efficient but lacks clarity for new agents or users. This requirement is to add a permanent, explicit legend to the header of that file.
- **SMRs:**
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-012.1:** Edit `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-012.2:** Add a 'Legend' section to the file's header.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-012.3:** The legend must define all Status abbreviations: `[P]` for Pending, `[I]` for In Progress, `[D]` for Deployed, `[H]` for Halted.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-012.4:** The legend must define all Priority abbreviations: `[C]` for Critical, `[H]` for High, `[M]` for Medium, `[L]` for Low.

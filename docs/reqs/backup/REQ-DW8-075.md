## ID: REQ-DW8-075

- **Title:** Implement Robust Command Output Handling
- **Status:** `Pending`
- **Priority:** `Critical`
- **Details:** The current mechanism for capturing shell command output is unreliable, often resulting in truncated or incomplete results. This prevents the AI from correctly diagnosing failures, as seen in the repeated `pytest` validation attempts. This requirement is to implement a new, robust method for capturing the complete, untruncated stdout and stderr of any command executed via the `run_command` tool.
- **SMRs:**
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-075.1:** Design a new `run_command_with_full_output` tool or modify the existing `run_command` tool.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-075.2:** The new mechanism must capture and return the full `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exit_code` without truncation.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-075.3:** The AI must use this new mechanism for all critical validation steps, especially `pytest`.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-075.4:** Create a test case that executes a command with a large amount of output and asserts that the full output was captured.

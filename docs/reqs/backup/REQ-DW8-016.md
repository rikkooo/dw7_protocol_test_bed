# REQ-DW8-016: [Sherlock Mode] Investigate and Fortify Workflow Adherence Protocol

- **Priority:** [H]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Sherlock Mode (Investigation & Design)

## 1. Description

It has been observed that the agent (Gem) sometimes operates outside the bounds of the prescribed development workflow. This "free as a bird" behavior indicates that the protocol has exploitable holes that compromise the structured, step-by-step process we aim to enforce.

This requirement initiates a "Sherlock Mode" investigation to understand why this happens and to design fortifications to keep the agent "on the tracks."

## 2. The Plan

### 2.1. Phase 1: Investigation

- **Behavioral Analysis:** Analyze past interactions and session logs to identify patterns or triggers that lead to deviations from the workflow.
- **Protocol Review:** Scrutinize the existing DW protocols to find ambiguities or missing constraints that might permit this behavior.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine if the cause is related to prompt engineering, tool limitations, or fundamental gaps in the state machine's logic.

### 2.2. Phase 2: Fortification Design

- **Define Strict Boundaries:** Collaboratively design new, explicit rules and constraints within the protocol to eliminate ambiguity.
- **Develop Self-Correction Mechanisms:** Brainstorm ways for the agent to recognize when it is deviating and prompt for a course correction or return to the established workflow.
- **Generate New Requirements:** Create a set of "Execution Mode" requirements to implement the designed protocol fortifications.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- A report is created that documents the root causes of workflow deviation.
- A set of new, fortified protocol rules is designed and documented.
- New requirements are created to implement these rules.

# REQ-DW8-011

## ID: REQ-DW8-011

- **Title:** Implement Deployer Configuration and Credential Management
- **Status:** `Pending`
- **Priority:** `Critical`
- **Details:** This requirement is to create a system for securely managing Git credentials and deployment paths to enable fully automated, non-interactive Git operations via the `github-mcp-server`.
- **SMRs:**
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-011.1:** On first run with a new project/user, the workflow must prompt for Git credentials (e.g., username and personal access token).
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-011.2:** Store the collected credentials securely in a project-local `.env` file, which should be added to `.gitignore`.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-011.3:** After storing credentials, ask the user for permission to configure the `github-mcp-server` with these credentials for future non-interactive use.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-011.4:** Create a new configuration file at `docs/DEPLOYER_CONFIGURATION.md` to store essential paths and URLs, such as the official protocol directory, the official protocol repository URL, and the project-specific repository URL.
  - [ ] **SMR-DW8-011.5:** The `DeployerStage` must be updated to read its operational parameters from this new configuration file.

# REQ-DW8-OS-007: [Execution] Refactor Requirement Files to JSON Events

- **Priority:** [H]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Execution

## 1. Description

This requirement completes the transition of our task definitions to a fully machine-readable format. All individual requirement documents in `/reqs/*.md` will be converted to structured JSON files in the new `/events/` directory. This makes them parsable and queryable by the system.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- A standard JSON schema for an "event" is defined.
- All existing `.md` requirement files are converted to `.json` event files in the `/events/` directory.
- The Kernel is updated to load the full event definition from this new location.

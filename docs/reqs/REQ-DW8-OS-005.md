# REQ-DW8-OS-005: [Execution] Implement Event Queue Completion Logic

- **Priority:** [C]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Execution

## 1. Description

This requirement implements the second half of the event queue logic. When an event is successfully completed (after the final stage in its instruction set), the Kernel must remove it from `data/pending_events.json` and append it to `data/processed_events.json`.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- A new method is added to the `WorkflowKernel` (e.g., `_finalize_event`).
- This method is called at the end of a successful workflow cycle.
- The method atomically reads the pending queue, removes the completed event, and appends it to the processed queue.

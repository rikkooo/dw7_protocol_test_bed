# REQ-DW8-017: [Execution] Refactor All Major Classes to Use Code Granularity Protocol

- **Priority:** [M]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Execution

## 1. Description

The Code Granularity Protocol, successfully implemented for `deployer.py`, has proven to be a powerful pattern for reducing context size, improving maintainability, and enhancing edit reliability. This pattern involves transforming large classes into lean interfaces that dynamically load their methods from individual files in a dedicated subdirectory.

This requirement serves as an epic or theme to apply this same refactoring pattern to all other major, monolithic classes within the project codebase.

## 2. The Plan

This will be a systematic, file-by-file refactoring effort to ensure stability. The general process for each class will be:

- **Identify Target Classes:** First, a comprehensive list of all major classes suitable for this refactoring will be compiled.
- **Create Interface:** For each class, a new interface file will be created that contains the dynamic loading logic.
- **Extract Methods:** Each method from the original class will be moved into its own separate file within a new subdirectory.
- **Update Class:** The original class file will be replaced by the new interface.
- **Incremental Testing:** After each class is refactored, the full test suite will be run to ensure no functionality has been broken.

## 3. Scope

This epic will be broken down into smaller, granular requirements, with each requirement targeting the refactoring of a single class file. This approach minimizes risk and allows for incremental progress. The initial list of target classes will be determined in a separate planning step.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- All identified major classes are successfully refactored into the new interface/granular function model.
- The codebase remains fully functional, with all existing tests passing.
- The overall context required for individual operations is significantly reduced.

# REQ-DW8-OS-002: [Execution] Replace `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` with Event Queues

- **Priority:** [C]
- **Status:** [P]
- **Type:** Execution

## 1. Description

This requirement is to replace the single, monolithic `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` file with a more robust and efficient dual-queue system implemented in JSON. This is a foundational step in the OS refactoring.

- **`pending_events.json`**: Will hold the list of tasks to be processed.
- **`processed_events.json`**: Will hold a log of completed tasks.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- The `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` file is removed from the system's logic (it can be archived).
- Two new files, `data/pending_events.json` and `data/processed_events.json`, are created.
- The system is able to initialize with these new empty files.

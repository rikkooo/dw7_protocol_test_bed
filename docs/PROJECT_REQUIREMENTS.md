- **Title:** [Prism Protocol] Enhance Codebase Docstrings for Code Atlas

- **Description:** Perform a comprehensive pass over the entire `src/dw6` codebase to enhance all public class and method docstrings. The docstrings should be clear, detailed, and formatted to produce a high-quality `API_REFERENCE.md` via the generator script.

- **SMRs:**
  - [ ] SMR-1: Systematically identify all Python files within `src/dw6` that require docstring updates, including core classes, stage classes, and dynamically loaded methods.
  - [ ] SMR-2: Update the docstrings for the core workflow classes: `WorkflowManager`, `WorkflowKernel`, and `WorkflowState`.
  - [ ] SMR-3: Update the docstrings for all stage-specific classes (`Engineer`, `Coder`, `Validator`, `Deployer`).
  - [ ] SMR-4: Update the docstrings for all dynamically loaded methods within the kernel and manager modules.
  - [ ] SMR-5: Execute the `scripts/generate_api_reference.py` script to generate the `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` file.
  - [ ] SMR-6: Verify that the generated `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` is complete, well-formatted, and accurately reflects the enhanced docstrings.

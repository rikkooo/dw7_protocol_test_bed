# Master Requirements List

### ID: REQ-DW8-VAL-002

- **Title:** Restore and Adapt Engineer Stage SMR Validation

- **Description:** The Engineer stage validation, which ensures requirements are broken down into at least two Sub-task Measurable Requirements (SMRs), was temporarily disabled to facilitate a documentation refactor (REQ-DW8-DOC-003). This requirement restores that validation logic to its original, correct state.

- **SMRs:**
  - [x] SMR-1: Restore `engineer.py` validation to read from `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
  - [x] SMR-2: Re-create the `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` file.
  - [ ] SMR-3: Verify the restored validation logic by approving the Engineer stage.

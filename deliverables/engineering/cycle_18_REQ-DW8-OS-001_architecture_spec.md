# Technical Specification: DW8 Operating System Architecture
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-DW8-OS-001
- **Author:** Cascade AI
- **Cycle:** 18
- **Status:** In Progress

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the formal architecture for the DW8 Operating System. It defines the core components, their responsibilities, and their interactions. This specification will serve as the foundational blueprint for all subsequent development of the DW8 protocol.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1. The Kernel
The Kernel is the central component of the DW8 OS. It is responsible for process management, resource allocation, and enforcing the rules of the workflow. It is the trusted core of the system.

### 2.2. Event Queues
The Event Queue is the primary mechanism for asynchronous communication between different components of the system. All inter-process communication is handled through a standardized event-driven model, ensuring loose coupling and scalability.

### 2.3. Registers
The Registers are the single source of truth for the system's state. They hold critical information such as the current stage, active requirement, and other key operational parameters. All state changes are transactional and logged.

### 2.4. Interrupt Handling
The Interrupt Handling system is responsible for managing asynchronous events and signals, such as user input or system alerts. It allows the workflow to respond to external events without disrupting the current process.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The technical specification document is complete and reviewed.
- [ ] The architecture described is robust, scalable, and aligns with the project's goals.
- [ ] The document clearly defines the interfaces between all core components.

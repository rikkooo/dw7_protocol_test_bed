----------------------

User Requirement: Create a new requirement REQ-DW8-010 with High priority, titled 'Implement Dual-Push for Protocol Evolution'. This is for projects where 'is_protocol_update' is true. SMRs should include: 1. At the end of a cycle, perform the standard project push to the test-bed repository. 2. After the first push, copy the updated workflow source code to the official protocol directory (path from DEPLOYER_CONFIGURATION.md). 3. Perform a second push of the updated protocol to the official 'windsurf-development-workflow' repository.

## 2. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.

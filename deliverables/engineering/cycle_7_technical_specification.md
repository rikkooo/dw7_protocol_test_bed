User Requirement: Implement the dw6 status command to display the current workflow state.

## 2. Detailed Implementation Plan

The `status` command will be added to the `dw6` command-line interface. It will provide a summary of the current state of the workflow.

### Sub-requirement 2.1: Add `status` command to CLI

**File to Modify:** `src/dw6/main.py`

1.  **Add `status` parser:** A new subparser for the `status` command will be added to the main `ArgumentParser`.
2.  **Implement `handle_status` function:** This new function will be called when the `status` command is invoked.

### Sub-requirement 2.2: Implement Status Logic

**File to Modify:** `src/dw6/main.py` (in the `handle_status` function)

1.  **Read State File:** The function will read `logs/workflow_state.txt` to get the `CurrentStage` and `RequirementPointer`.
2.  **Read Validation Report:** It will read `dw7_validation_report.md` and parse it to find the title and description of the requirement matching the `RequirementPointer`.
3.  **Display Status:** The function will print a formatted output to the console, including:
    *   Current Cycle
    *   Current Stage
    *   Current Requirement ID and Description

This will provide the user with immediate and clear visibility into the project's status.

## 3. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.

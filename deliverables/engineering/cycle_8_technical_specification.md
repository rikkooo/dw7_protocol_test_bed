User Requirement: Automate the creation of a placeholder research report during the Researcher stage approval.

## 2. Detailed Implementation Plan

The `Researcher` stage has an undocumented, blocking requirement to create a research report. This will be fixed by automating the creation of a placeholder report if one does not already exist when the stage is approved.

### Sub-requirement 2.1: Automate Research Report Generation

**File to Modify:** `src/dw6/state_manager.py`

1.  **Locate the Approval Logic:** The changes will be made within the `_validate_researcher_stage` method of the `WorkflowManager` class.
2.  **Implement the Check-and-Create Logic:**
    *   Before validating the stage, the method will check if a research report for the current cycle exists (e.g., `deliverables/research/cycle_8_research_report.md`).
    *   If the file is not found, the method will automatically create it.
    *   The auto-generated file will contain simple placeholder text, such as: `"No formal research was required for this cycle. This deliverable was auto-generated to satisfy the workflow requirements."`

This change ensures the `Researcher` stage can always be completed, removing the hidden dependency and making the workflow more resilient and user-friendly.

## 3. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.

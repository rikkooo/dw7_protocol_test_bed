----------------------

User Requirement: Create a new requirement REQ-DW8-004 with High priority, titled 'Implement Rehearsal Stage Logic'. The goal is to replace the placeholder logic in the Rehearsal stage with a process for analyzing failures, re-evaluating plans, and generating at least two alternative solutions. SMRs should include: reading error logs, summarizing the failure, formulating two alternatives, presenting them for approval, and updating the AI protocol tutorial.

## 2. Guiding Principles

**Working Philosophy:** We always look to granularize projects into small, atomic requirements and sub-requirements. The more granular the requirement, the easier it is to scope, implement, test, and validate. This iterative approach minimizes risk and ensures steady, verifiable progress.

# Research Summary for REQ-DW8-011

## 1. Objective

To implement a robust and persistent virtual environment management system for the DW8 protocol, as detailed in the technical specification for `REQ-DW8-011`.

## 2. Research Findings

A review of `src/dw6/state_manager.py` confirms the implementation plan:

1.  **`WorkflowState.initialize_state()`:** This is the correct entry point to inject the one-time environment setup logic. The implementation will involve using Python's `os` and `subprocess` modules to check for the existence of the venv directory and create it if necessary. The absolute path to the new Python executable will be added to the state dictionary.

2.  **`WorkflowManager._validate_tests()`:** This method is the ideal candidate for demonstrating the use of the persisted path. The existing `subprocess.run` call will be modified to fetch the `PythonExecutablePath` from the state object.

3.  **Testing:** A new test file, `tests/test_environment_management.py`, will be created to unit test these changes in isolation, using mocks for file system and subprocess interactions.

## 3. Conclusion

The research confirms that the plan outlined in the technical specification is sound and directly implementable. No alternative approaches are necessary. The next step is to proceed to the `Coder` stage to implement these changes.

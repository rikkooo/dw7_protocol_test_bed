## Finding 2: `dw6 setup` command does not exist

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Project Setup
- **Description:** After correcting the execution to use `uv run`, the command `dw6 setup` still fails because it is not a valid subcommand in the `dw6` CLI tool. The available commands are 'approve', 'new', 'meta-req', 'tech-debt', 'revert', 'do'.
- **Impact:** Critical. The documented automated setup process is non-functional and based on a feature that does not exist.
- **Recommendation:** The `start-project-dw7.md` workflow must be completely rewritten. The `setup` command needs to be implemented in the `dw6` tool, or the workflow must be changed to explicitly list the manual Git commands required for initialization (add remote, commit, push).# DW7 Protocol Validation Report

This document tracks all findings, flaws, and improvement points discovered during the validation of the DW7 protocol.

## Finding 1: `dw6` command not found during setup

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Project Setup
- **Description:** The `start-project-dw7.md` workflow attempts to execute `dw6 setup ...` directly. This fails because the command is installed within the project's virtual environment and is not in the system's default PATH.
- **Impact:** Critical. The project setup fails, blocking the entire workflow.
- **Recommendation:** All commands provided by the project's dependencies (like `dw6` or `pytest`) must be executed using `uv run`. The workflow script must be updated.
- **Correct Command:** `uv run dw6 setup "[PROJECT_NAME]" "[REMOTE_URL]"`

# DW6 Workflow: Project Complete

**Status:** Production Ready

This project has successfully completed all planned requirements to harden and automate the DW6 development protocol. The workflow is now considered stable and ready for use.

## Key Achievements:

-   **Requirement 1:** Robust Environment and Dependency Management
-   **Requirement 2:** Seamless, Programmatic GitHub Integration
-   **Requirement 3:** Automated Coder Deliverable Generation
-   **Requirement 4:** Enforced Test Presence in Validator Stage
-   **Requirement 5:** Automated Push to Remote Repository

The workflow has been reset and is ready for the next development cycle.

## Flexible Researcher Stage

The DW6 protocol now includes a flexible workflow path that allows for an optional `Researcher` stage. This is controlled by the `--needs-research` flag when approving the `Engineer` stage.

- **Standard Path (`Engineer` -> `Coder`):** By default, approving the `Engineer` stage transitions the workflow directly to the `Coder` stage.
- **Research Path (`Engineer` -> `Researcher` -> `Coder`):** If a requirement needs additional research, use the `approve --needs-research` command. This will transition the workflow to the `Researcher` stage, allowing for dedicated research before proceeding to the `Coder` stage.

**Final State:**
-   **Current Stage:** Engineer
-   **Next Requirement ID:** 6

## Finding 14: Inflexible Governor Rules Prevent Failure Recovery

- **Cycle:** 4
- **Stage:** Validator
- **Description:** The `Validator` stage failed due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `httpx`. This is a known issue (Finding 4: Incomplete Test Dependencies) with a known workaround (Finding 5: use `uv run python -m pytest`). However, the Governor's rules for the `Validator` stage only permit the failing `uv run pytest` command, creating a deadlock. The workflow cannot be fixed or advanced without manual intervention.
- **Impact:** Catastrophic. The Governor, intended to enforce stability, has made the workflow brittle and unrecoverable from known, fixable issues.
- **Recommendation:** The Governor's rules must be updated to be more flexible. Specifically, the `Validator` stage rules must be immediately updated to allow the working `uv run python -m pytest` command. The broader implication is that all stages may need a way to handle known failure states without requiring a full manual reset.

## Finding 13: State Machine Does Not Roll Back on Failure

- **Cycle:** 1/2 Transition
- **Stage:** Deployer
- **Description:** When the `Deployer` stage approval failed, the state machine remained in that broken stage. It did not gracefully handle the error or allow a new cycle to begin, requiring a manual edit of the state file to proceed.
- **Impact:** Critical. This prevents the workflow from self-recovering from failures and blocks all future development.
- **Recommendation:** The state manager needs a transaction-like system. If any part of a stage transition fails, it should roll back to the previous stable state.## Finding 13: State Machine Does Not Roll Back on Failure

- **Description:** When the `Deployer` stage approval failed, the state machine remained in that broken stage. It did not gracefully handle the error or allow a new cycle to begin, requiring a manual edit of the state file to proceed.

- **Recommendation:** The state manager needs a transaction-like system. If any part of a stage transition fails, it should roll back to the previous stable state.## Finding 12: Cycle Counter Does Not Increment

- **Cycle:** 2
- **Stage:** Engineer
- **Description:** When starting a new cycle with `dw6 new`, the tool does not increment the cycle number in the generated deliverable filenames. It reused `cycle_6` for the new specification, which will lead to deliverables from different cycles overwriting each other.
- **Impact:** Critical. This is a data integrity issue that makes it impossible to track deliverables across multiple cycles.
- **Recommendation:** The state management system must be updated to correctly track and increment the cycle number for all generated deliverables.## Finding 11: Catastrophic Git Integration Failure

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Deployer
- **Description:** The `Deployer` stage fails with a `git fetch` error due to a malformed URL, created by incorrectly embedding credentials. This points to a fundamental flaw in how the `dw6` tool interacts with Git for remote operations.
- **Impact:** Catastrophic. The deployment process is completely non-functional and unreliable.
- **Recommendation:** The entire Git interaction layer for remote operations in the `dw6` tool must be deprecated. It should be replaced with robust, programmatic calls to the `github-mcp-server`, which handles authentication and API interactions correctly.## Finding 9: Missing `GITHUB_TOKEN` for Deployment

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Deployer
- **Description:** The `Deployer` stage fails with an error requiring a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be set in the environment. This is an undocumented requirement.
- **Impact:** Critical. The workflow cannot be completed.
- **Recommendation:** The requirement for a `GITHUB_TOKEN` must be documented. The tool should also provide a clearer error message and guidance.

## Finding 10: `.env` File Loading is Broken

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Deployer
- **Description:** Even after creating a valid `.env` file with the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the `dw6` tool fails to load it when executed via `uv run`. The environment variable is not detected.
- **Impact:** Critical. This indicates a fundamental incompatibility between the tool's environment handling and modern execution wrappers like `uv run`.
- **Recommendation:** The tool's environment variable loading mechanism must be rewritten to be robust and compatible with standard execution environments.## Finding 8: Undocumented Research Report Requirement

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Researcher
- **Description:** Attempting to approve the `Researcher` stage fails because of a missing, undocumented deliverable: `deliverables/research/cycle_6_research_report.md`. The CLI provides no command to create this required file.
- **Impact:** Critical. The workflow is permanently blocked without prior knowledge of this hidden requirement.
- **Recommendation:** The `dw6` tool must be updated to automatically generate the research report template, or the requirement must be clearly documented and a command provided to fulfill it.# DW7 Protocol Validation Report

This document tracks all findings, flaws, and improvement points discovered during the validation of the DW7 protocol.

## Finding 1: `dw6` command not found during setup

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Project Setup
- **Description:** The `start-project-dw7.md` workflow attempts to execute `dw6 setup ...` directly. This fails because the command is installed within the project's virtual environment and is not in the system's default PATH.
- **Impact:** Critical. The project setup fails, blocking the entire workflow.
- **Recommendation:** All commands provided by the project's dependencies (like `dw6` or `pytest`) must be executed using `uv run`.

## Finding 2: `dw6 setup` command does not exist

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Project Setup
- **Description:** The workflow depends on a `dw6 setup` command that does not exist in the tool.
- **Impact:** Critical. The documented automated setup process is non-functional.
- **Recommendation:** The `start-project-dw7.md` workflow must be rewritten. Either the `setup` command must be implemented, or the workflow must list the required manual Git commands.

## Finding 3: Git push authentication failure

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Project Setup
- **Description:** The `git push` command failed due to a lack of credentials in the execution environment.
- **Impact:** Critical. The project cannot be synchronized with the remote repository.
- **Recommendation:** The workflow must include a step to configure Git with the necessary credentials.

## Finding 4: Incomplete Test Dependencies

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Project Setup (Verification)
- **Description:** The `pyproject.toml` was missing `httpx` from its `test` dependencies.
- **Impact:** Critical. The project's test suite is not reproducible.
- **Recommendation:** The `pyproject.toml` in the template must be updated to include all required test dependencies.

## Finding 5: `uv run pytest` Command Fails

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Project Setup (Verification)
- **Description:** The command `uv run pytest` fails due to an incompatibility with the `pytest` script runner, while `uv run python -m pytest` succeeds.
- **Impact:** High. The prescribed method for running tests is unreliable.
- **Recommendation:** The workflow should use the more robust module-based invocation: `uv run python -m pytest`.

## Finding 6: Flawed Integration Test Environment

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Project Setup (Verification)
- **Description:** A key integration test failed because it did not create a necessary Git repository in its temporary test environment.
- **Impact:** High. A flawed test suite gives a false sense of security.
- **Recommendation:** Tests must be responsible for creating their own required environment and preconditions.

## Finding 7: Non-existent `dw6 status` command

- **Cycle:** 1
- **Stage:** Engineer
- **Description:** The workflow documentation refers to a `dw6 status` command to check the project's state, but this command does not exist in the CLI tool.
- **Impact:** High. The user is unable to verify the current workflow stage as prescribed.
- **Recommendation:** The `status` command must be implemented in the `dw6` tool to provide essential visibility into the workflow state.
